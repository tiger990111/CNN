    "  - When you get to `Step 6: Configure Security Group`, you have some decisions to make.\n",
    "    * Option 1: Keep the default security group.  You will be able to launch the instance, `ssh` to it, and run jobs on it, but you won't be able to open a `Juptyer` notebook from the instance.\n",

    "  - Choose the correct authentication key and launch the instance!\n",
