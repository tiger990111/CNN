# Final Project Instructions

## Statement
The goal of this project is to read about and implement a neural network architecture that was not discussed in class.  You
are provided a blog post for two project topics.  The blog posts describe the architecture in detail and also provide links
to the original paper on the topic as well as code.  You must select **one** blog post for your project.

### Project Topics
Select **one** of the following project topics:
- [UNet](https://towardsdatascience.com/u-net-b229b32b4a71)
- [ResNet](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-coding-a-resnet-in-keras-446d7ff84d33)

### Requirements
* Read and understand the blog post.  You may need to read other sources including the original paper.
* Implement the architecture described in the blog post.
  - Your implementation **must be in Keras**.
* Use the dataset described in the blog post.
* Train and test the network on the provided dataset.
  - How does the loss look?
  - How do the results compare to a fully-connected network or a standard CNN?
  - What is the accuracy of the model?
  - Did you need to use any regularization?
  - Other consideration?

## Logistics
* **Presentation Date and Time**:  Wednesday, November 27th at 10:00 AM (Boston Time, EST)
* Each group will have **10 minutes** to present their project with **5** minutes for Q&A.
  - 10 minutes for the actual presentation
  - 5 minutes for questions
  - **Important:** Do not exceed the allotted 10 minutes!
* Follow the presentation template described below

## Presentation Template / Outline
* Your presentation should have 7-10 slides of content.
* You can have 1 more slide in addition to the content slides for the title page.

Your presentation should be structured as follows:
### Introduction
* Describe the problem
* Explain your approach to the problem
* Explain how your chosen architecture works
### Methodology
* Describe your dataset (what it is, where it came from, how big it is)
* Describe your code (what packages you used, anything new that you wrote)
* **DO NOT** present any code!
### Results
* Present your results
* Describe their meaning
### Conclusions
* Discuss what you learned from the problem
* Speculate on any improvements that can be made
